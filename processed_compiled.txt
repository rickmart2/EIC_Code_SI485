Besides~ some were sent to Jambee on the Simon & Jude~ and the Dove~ and some on the Star to Macassar.

032,NA, The power given to pursers is so great that they dare do anything without control. Coming into the Road of Swally~ they are purely sent on shore~ pretending the Company's service~ which is nothing less. First~ they sell their own private goods such as quiet silver~ lead in bars~ vermillion~ and coral~ most vendible~ otherwise the Company's goods of the like nature (if first landed) might come to a far better market than usually they do if their going on shore were prevented.

The Company might easily prevent this by sending a faithful servant first on shore to buy the like commodities~ which would hinder the private trade both of India and Persia.

They converted the proceeds into black pepper and gold~ to the great prejudice of the Company. By this means~ 50 bales of the Company's goods were left unsold~ carried to a less favorable market~ and the ship was deprived of her full lading. The censure for this matter was referred home.

034,Jul 4th 1632, Their fines were later reduced to 200 each.
034,Jul 4th 1632, A letter from the President and Council~ dated January 25~ 1632~ states that George Gosnell brought up to Surat 60 barrels of quicksilver for himself and others.
034,Jul 4th 1632, Bunter’s estate was required to be detained until the arrival of the ship Mary~ as he had passed an unjust account at Masulipatam.

Many of the men were distempered with drink. Mr. makes governor's mate Penwarden & 5 guns to salute the Mary~ whereof: in the game came 13 more or 4. The ship found Lambert the author of all the mischief. Per letter dated the 12th of August 1633~ Mr. Miller advises as follows: Grade as quicksilver & landed at Surat. Private Anno: 1632: did so damage the price of commodities at Surat~ that the Company's goods were carried on to Agra in hope of a better market~ but there also the market was forestalled by private men's goods sent up before the Company's~ whereof the Company's lay long unsold~ & at length were put off with great loss. 28 maunds of quicksilver~ sent up on deal by Nathaniel Mountney to Agra~ & 4 maunds of vermilion besides other goods for his own account: and the 50 ounces of Abashees & a great unknown quantity of Ryals belonging to Mr. Mountney & Joyce Gelacon with customs etc. Surprised by the Rajputs between Surat and Juytho and Swally~ besides other goods being the Company's return of private trade from Persia~ for recovery.

Joyce~ apprehended for it~ was committed to irons for it 10 days~ and after great towardness~ pistasses released. This affirmed by Hunter in his relation August 20th~ 1633.

For this inconsistency and conflicting report of sums given at Jambi~ his account is not cleared~ but the matter is referred to the Company’s censure.

The estate of Christopher Fleming is due to answer for the surplus of pepper purported to be laden above ship parts~ and Ivy is involved therein. Mr. Pinson used the Company’s estate for his own profit~ though his estate was deposited to cover this. Mr. Coulson similarly used the Company’s estate for his own benefit.

050, Oct 1st 1636, From G. Pinson and T. Clarke to Bantam: Mr. Cartwright was examined regarding dead men’s estates in his hands~ submitted an account~ and delivered it. It appeared that he owed 4~483 rupees. Additionally~ in the Petapoly accounts~ he owes 180 more than previously advised~ which should have been settled long ago. Mr. Cartwright is considered a disparagement to the English and the Coast due to his extravagant behavior. Rud Binson is indebted to the Company for 214 pagodas or £107 sterling for 85 double riders.

After Coleson’s death~ the two Johnsons~ now secretaries~ shared Pinson’s money between themselves. Henry Johnson~ in December~ received 500 Rs. from William Johnson and gave a receipt. On January 7~ he received another 500 Rs.~ altered the date of the first receipt to match the latter date~ and issued only one receipt for the sums. William shortly after discovered this and questioned Henry about it. Henry then disclosed the concealment of Pinson’s money~ as per the consultation in book N: K. 15 bales of Tuckarees brought by William Johnson from the West Coast were missing~ for which he must be answerable to the Company.
052, NA, Before his death~ Colson set aside 250 Rs. of the Company’s money to cover his funeral charges. William Johnson took this money from Colson’s cabinet~ made Colson a debtor for his burial~ and did not record the 250 Rs. or any part of it.

Next~ that Gibson and he both lent 4~000 tomaans to the Dutch. Bath was removed from being Agent for the cause~ and Honnywood was chosen. The money lent to the Dutch bought away the silk provided by the King to satisfy the debt to the Company. Bath was discharged as an evil member out of the Company's employment. His papers~ books~ goods~ and estate were seized and confiscated for the Company's use. Bath~ confined to the Company's house~ fled to the Dutch~ stayed there~ and died. Bath connived with the Agent.

This same practice was confessed to have continued after his death. Gibson was knowledgeable in the Company’s accounts. H. Chapman gave 24 tons to the writer in the custom house without order. Chapman and Hall gave bills of captaincy to the Dutch at Bandar for 2~000 tons~ payable at Surat. They charged the Agent at Spahan at 32 ½ rupees to be paid at a day’s sight.

Mr. Willoughby projects an unnecessary voyage to Aceh and sends Diggory Penkevill~ for which Mr. Willoughby’s estate ought to give satisfaction to the value of 2420 rials. See the former advice: Mr. Willoughby’s account dissatisfies 50 rials for sandalwood.
057,Oct 25th 1639,By letter from Masulipatam~ 25 October 1639: Francis Day sent 12 cargoes of cloth to the southwards~ private trade. Nathaniel Wick indebted 30 pagodas.

058,NA,Another bale of silk sent to Golconda and there sold~ but for how much Clarke knows not~ and a bale of stuffs sold at Bantam for Mr. Clarke's account~ both belonging to deceased men.

058,NA,Thomas Rogers's negligence in not sending his accounts from Golconda~ and various desperate debts made there by him.
058,NA,Mr. Pinson is to make good 200 pagodas at the Coast for not sending well-mixed scarlet and stammel to Merhatuckee for melicks received~ or else the Company will lose those 200 pagodas. Mr. Pinson is blamed for much negligence in the Company's affairs.

058,NA,950 pagodas were taken up at interest by Mr. Pinson and Clarke at 2% and 8%~ with various errors in Clarke's books. Factors at Masulipatnam could wish~ whereas Mr. Clarke has at times sent home £800.

059,NA,Read to the end: Mr. Willoughby Thomas Rogers prodigal in his expenses at Golconda and the debts made there accounted desperate. Hudson’s ill behavior has gained all the people’s hatred~ especially the great ones~ as dealing in their grain here and taking upon himself the government of towns. The troubles in Visakhapatnam occasioned by Hudson cost the Company dearly~ who justifies the putting of Clarke in irons and wishes it had been done sooner. They desire no estate of Clarke and Hudson’s to be paid until the Company hears further and call in Hudson’s books of accounts. No sum served.
059,NA,Thomas Rogers~ though stayed~ is shunned as a delinquent and has spent much of the Company’s estate and all his own except his wages. By letter from Bantam~ Clarke and Hudson’s loss of gold and silver~ which they ought to repair~ they are sent home as prisoners to answer what shall be objected against them~ which will amount to no valuable consideration in comparison to the loss the Company has sustained. Their great neglect in accounts:

061,Jun 24th 1640,Mr. Elton was found to lose all his ways from 29th July 1639 till his arrival in England~ 24 June 1640~ and to make good 30 rest stolen~ yet by him charged to account of profit and loss.

062,Apr 16th 1641,Richard Hudson made in bad debts at Veraskerone to the amount of 8000 R of 8. Richard Hudson~ having received ready money~ invested most in cloth at Veraskerone. Being a petty merchant~ he delivered to the weavers two-thirds in argan and one-quarter in money. This has been noted as indirect dealing. Richard Hudson~ in taking upon himself the governance of towns when he was not able to govern himself by the rule of honesty~ drew many inconveniences after him. Richard Hudson has infinitely wronged the Company by not bringing to account a customary allowance called dastury~ which is every 1/15 penny~ as a fanam upon each pagoda. The omission~ if not prevented~ will be a great hindrance to the Company in the future. Richard Hudson paid the Curtingans at Masulipatam in cloves 600 or 700 R of 8 more than was due to them~ upon satisfying them the 4000 R of 8 borrowed by them. Richard Hudson constrained Clarke~ in his weak estate~ to clear the due debt of one Devegee amounting to 400 and another pagoda.
062,Nov 8th 1639,By letter from Masulipatam to Buratt dated the 8th of November 1639: Thomas Clarke is not fit for any employment unless it is to sit in a tavern. Indeed~ drinking and other excesses have consumed his body~ goods~ and good parts. Diverse debts were made by Thomas Rogers in Enhondak~ for which there is nothing to show. Thomas Rogers’ accounts are so extravagant and vague that we even feel shame to see them. He could produce no particulars~ having kept none~ but made up his accounts without detail.
063,NA,Jewels in cloves bought by Mr. Pinson cost 180 pagodas. Three are not worth 10 pagodas of any man’s money~ being not as good as Bristol stones.
063,Apr 16th 1641,Thomas Clarke’s relation the 16th of April 1641 in writing. Mr. Hunter brought from Macassar a great quantity of china~ and he knew not what to do with it. He sold it to the Company at a dear rate~ several items of which Mr. Pinson knew very well would not sell. Mr. Pinson bore only the name of the President~ for Mr. Hunter did and undid what he pleased. Mr. Pinson took for his sea provisions from the coast to Bantam certain chests of fruit and rosewater belonging to Meer Zassau worth 100 pagodas~ for which he paid freight of 20 h. pagandas.
063,Jan 16th 1638,Mr. Cartwright’s affidavit: Thomas Clarke was very poor at his first arrival. Clarke kept part of the Company’s goods at Ballisara and pretended he was robbed of it and his own together~ to the value of 280 pounds or thereabouts. Clarke refused to deliver his accounts to his principal as he ought~ but sent them to Bantam incomplete~ from whence they were returned to Masulipatam again. Mr. Pinson and Clarke lived at Masulipatam at a very high and extraordinary rate in the expense of the Company’s means~ putting them to the charge of keeping 10 horses~ 2 oxen~ 11 palanquins~ sometimes 40~ other times 60~ and at other times 80 servants belonging to the house. When Pinson and Clarke went out of town together (as was usual)~ a trumpeter rode before them. Likewise~ there were two flags carried before them~ and one of the country’s feniers went ahead of the palanquins they rode in. Behind him followed the palanquins~ by whose sides went soldiers carrying broad things like targets to keep away the sun or rain. They were also accompanied by horsemen~ footmen (English and others)~ and servants. This was their manner of going abroad for recreation.
064,NA,Thomas Clarke had belonging unto him and did share usually 20 servants and slaves~ whose wages were borne in part by the Company~ and the rest was paid by himself~ as Clarke said. That the said Clarke kept a house of his own wherein was a porter and three other slaves or servants. That Mr. Pinson and Clarke had a warehouse apart in Masulipatam for their own use.
064,Aug 30th 1638,Charles’ letter out of Persia~ 30 August 1638: Mr. Sibson’s ill carriage to Ettemon Dowlett caused loss to the Company’s business. Agent Bibson never suffered the factors to see his books of account. Henry Chapman’s neglect to call the Dutch to the inventorizing of John Willoughby’s estate. The factors take notice of the Company’s complaint against Agent Sibson’s dishonest dealings and Cany Bath~ his accomplice~ in his unfaithful accounts.
064,NA,Particular letter of the same date: All the Persian factors condemned for ill lives. The vast expenses in 1631~ 1632~ and 1633: £8150 spent in those three years~ and £2666 13s 4d spent yearly in traveling charges. Since Bibson’s death~ £1833 6s 8d spent in six months.
065,Jun 13th 1639,Per letter out of Persia dated the 13th of June 1639 Concerning Gibsons and Willoughby’s deceits in the customs and the Agent's opinion of them both. Mr. Willoughby 50 Tomands lent by Gibson to Sultan Blocky not to be recovered. They detest Gibson's lending the Company's monies to the Dutch~ holding it rather theft than deceit. No accounts kept by Gibson in 1637. Gibson's hand for 4000 ducats of cloth~ a loss to the Company of 80 ducats. Henry Chapman~ his drawing of 2000 Tomands by bill of exchange upon the Agent~ though he received no money of the Dutch.

065,Jun 13th 1639,Per letter out of Persia dated the 13th of June 1639 They send the accounts of Guy Bath~ Robert Manly~ and Mark Bromely~ whose evil behavior ought to be further questioned. Bromely found indebted more than they supposed.
065,Aug 30th 1638,Per letter out of Persia dated the 30th of August 1638. The Agent hath sent Mark Bromely for India~ one fit to corrupt the factory and for nothing else.
066,Jul 18th 1637,Per letter out of Persia dated the 18th of July 1637. Agent Sibson blamed for not perfecting the Persian account. Agent Sibson omitting to send Etteman Dowlat his piscashe caused him to defer the weighing of silk unto your servants~ to the Company's detriment. By Agent Sibson's neglect~ they receive silk far short of the quantity promised to the Company~ an inconceivable damage. Guy Bath will not consent that anyone shall see Agent Gibson's papers but himself. The Agent and his only counsel~ Bath~ lent Tomands to the Dutch. Guy Bath discharged as an evil member out of the Company's employment~ his books~ papers~ and goods seized. Bath~ a private trader with the Agent~ traded 191~112 shakees in goods bought from the Dutch~ sold again for 200 Tomands profit. Bath confined to the Company's house~ flees to the Dutch. Bath connived at by the President~ his estate valued at 70 Tomands.

Besides this~ he also took five tuns of beer from the King’s ship.
067,Dec 29th 1640,By letter by the Crispiana from Surat~ 29th December 1640: Mr. Cogan to explain why 2~000 parcels of goods~ said to belong to the King of Golconda~ should be landed at Gombroon custom-free~ without informing the factors at Surat. Upon learning of this~ they disapproved~ calling it tyrannical. New litanies were drafted to pray for wiser handling of such issues and deliverance from current displeasures.
068,Nov 15th 1641,By letter per ship Mary from Bantam~ 15th November 1641: Mr. George Willoughby to be questioned about 4~257 Ryalls due by the king of Acheyn~ he being George Willoughby dead~ and the debt lost.

Fort St. George was not built by order from Surat. The Coast factors are charged with neglects and errors~ with their overly brief expressions in their journals~ where no man can be satisfied~ nor can their meanings by their accounts be rightly apprehended.
069,Jan 27th 1641,By letter from Surat dated 27th January 1641~ per ship London: John Jeffries to give account of various Portuguese goods received about the Swan~ for their freight.
069,Aug 25th 1643,By letter from Fort St. George per ship Mary~ dated 25th August 1643: John Yard~ having express orders to pay the debts he owes in the Bay~ neglects to clear them.

However~ Mr. Yard misused the money sent to clear those debts on a tool not worthy of being called a ship. For this unadvised action~ he must be held responsible.
069,Jan 10th 1643,By letter from Bantam~ 10th January 1643: Mr. John Yard receives his passage on the Hopewell and awaits only your approval of his good endeavors. He submits to your impartial judgment~ having placed his estate—13 bales of goods on the Hopewell—in your hands to make satisfaction for any alleged wrongdoings. In his defense~ we pray that you hear us~ review his writings~ and allow him to speak for himself. Despite what has been written about him from Surat and the Coast~ and the harsh judgment from England~ we humbly believe him to be innocent. We have seen letters that granted him absolute authority to buy the Endeavour~ mentioning three times the directive to procure a good vessel. We leave this to your fair judgment. Additionally~ Mr. John Gard is a man deserving of your favor and employment again~ should you choose to engage him. He is willing and content to serve.
070,Dec 29th 1640,Mr. Cogan's first charge: To answer concerning the building of the fort St. George~ Crispian's letter~ 29th December 1640~ the charge whereof hath cost from the first of March 1639 to the 30th June 1643~ Pagoda new 9250. To give account whether it be finished or how far it has proceeded. To answer what the charge of the soldiers monthly is to maintain the fort~ as well as for wages~ victuals~ and otherwise. To give an account of what paintings have been yearly bought at Madraspatan.
070,Feb 20th 1640,To answer the complaint of 20~000 Ryalls of private trade in the Thomas between him and Mr. Jong in Court~ 20th February 1640.
070,Dec 29th 1649,To give reason why 2~000 parcels of goods said to belong to the King of Golconda should be landed at Combeoone~ Crispian's letter~ certain free~ with which he never acquainted the factor at Surat~ who upon notice thereof disliked the same~ 29th December 1649.
070,Nov 8th 1641,To give a reason for the total aversion from Parte Marius’ letter of all the cargo designed from England thither by ship Hopewell in 1640. To give an account of whom 120 bales of private trade did belong~ which were in that ship on that voyage. To give a reason for not returning the pinnace Adrico when the Coast Justors wrote to Bantam purposely for a ship whereupon she was sent thither with a stock of 3~157 Ryalls~ which proved to the Company’s great detriment by wanting her during the Bantam season for the Europe ships. To give an account of the unprovident expending of such means as hath been consigned to this Coast~ to be invested there for supply of the Continent factories~ which have well near overthrown the spice trade~ besides it was then likely to make the factors at Bantam a public shame and derision to the Dutch.
071,NA,Mr. Cogan: To give a reason why the Reformation's cargo from the Coast to Bantam amounted to no more than half the capital sent out of England~ for the whole cargo was ordered to be invested at the Court and returned to Bantam~ and why the charges of the ship at Joanna and the Coast while she stayed there were included in the invoice. To give a reason how the debt of 14~079 pagodas~ or 28~758 Ryalls at 2% per month interest~ occurred at the Coast at the departure of the ship Reformation~ when very recently before~ they wrote that the Company was completely out of debt at Masulipatam. To give a reason how they came into debt to the factory at Bantam for 66~436 Ryalls~ besides the 28~758 Ryalls mentioned before. To give a reason why the paintings that came upon the Reformation were so poorly sorted~ with dead colors~ base works~ and such narrow and short cloth (one bale only excepted)~ that the Justors at Bantam never saw worse come from thence. This is surprising~ as the Coast factors had previously highly extolled and commended that place for plenty and abundance of all sorts of good cloth and other commodities at cheaper rates than anywhere else~ as well as for the rare and rich paintings made there. To give a reason for the excessive expenses and charges at the Coast~ by means of which expenses neither the factors at Surat nor those at Bantam seldom saw the moiety of what the Company from England or either of those factories furnished them with. To give a reason why uncivil and unsatisfactory answers are returned to Surat by the Coast factors when they were mildly reproached for their unreasonable proceedings~ such as neglects~ improvidence~ errors~ and the like~ as expressed briefly in their journals. When neither the Justors at Surat nor any other person can be satisfied by the abstracts of accounts~ instead of better information from the Coast Justors~ they receive nothing but taunting replies.
072,NA,To give a reason why the Justors at the Coast sent the pinnace Draymond with a cargo of 21~385 Ryalls to Bantam~ being a rotten~ unserviceable bottom~ manned with only 8 Englishmen~ a boy~ and a few unserviceable Blacks. The goods being within her caused damage to the Company (not less than 1~000 pounds sterling)~ when that cargo might have been sent by the Advice rather than sending her to Persia. And had not the Daniel relieved the Draymond with men~ money~ water~ bread~ salt flesh~ and several other provisions~ it would have been almost impossible for her to gain her port.
072,Jan 13th 1642,To give a reason for the strange and unwarrantable proceedings of the factors at the Coast in disposing of the Company’s estate sent to them out of England by the Hopewell~ absolutely contrary to orders from England and letters from Surat by the said ship and also from Surat overland to the Court.
072,Feb 21st 1642,To give a reason for their newly invented way of accounts~ and why they included their charges for three years of building their fort and the area of interest into the general accounts of Bantam~ thereby covering and hiding their own unwarrantable actions.
072,Jan 20th 1644,By order of Court~ 20th January 1644: Thomas Whatmore~ master of the Draymond~ to be questioned about the defects of the said ship upon his return from India.
073,NA,Mr. Cogan's second charge: To give an account of what quantity of cloves were put into the Hopewell at Masulipatam and for whose account. To give an account of how long the Hopewell stayed at Ballicara~ the reason for her prolonged stay there~ and also what freight~ goods~ and passengers she brought from thence to be landed at Masulipatam and Persia~ and what other goods were laden upon her for the Company's account and for any of the Commissioners~ general traders~ or others. Likewise~ what freight is brought to the Company's account by Mr. Day. What Mr. Day has charged to the Company's account for victuals and provisions of the ship Hopewell during her stay at Ballicara. To give a reason for the stay of the ship Hopewell at Masulipatam for 13 days in her passage from Ballicara to Persia~ and to demonstrate what goods were taken aboard that ship~ as well for the Company as for any of their factors or others. To give an account of what goods were put aboard the Hopewell at Madraspatam in her passage to Persia~ what goods were taken onshore there~ and the reason. To give an account of what goods~ both of the Company's and of their factors and other men~ were brought from Persia and taken onshore at Madraspatam. What freight Mr. Day brought to account from Persia to Dabhol and then to the Court of Coromandel. To give a reason for sending the ship Hopewell to Trincomalee~ how long she stayed there~ what goods were bought there for the Company's account~ and what for their factors and others' accounts. Also~ what other vessels with goods and other commodities came or were to come from Trincomalee to Madraspatam and for whose account. What stock Mr. Day carried for the Company's account and how it was disposed of. To give an account of what goods were put aboard the Hopewell for the Company~ their factors~ or other particular men at Masulipatam and Madraspatam~ and taken onshore at Bantam and by whom.
074,NA,To give an account of the demeanor and behavior of Thomas Penniston~ Thomas Winter~ Henry Greenshine~ and John Varen~ and in what sort or manner they live~ and whether there be any collaboration of private trade between them to the Company's prejudice. And whether they~ or some of them~ do not usually buy cloth and paintings at the best season of the year~ and when ships come together~ do they not make the Company pay a greater rate for such goods than they were originally bought for. And whether some or all of them do not~ to prevent the knowledge of this fraud~ order the brokers and weavers for 16 miles around not to sell under their price~ and do they not lend to the weavers that are in necessity money at such times to keep up the price of their cloth.
074,Oct 4th and 20th 1643,By letter from the Coast of the 4th and 20th of October 1643: If Mr. Varen has not acted his part well~ you will now have him with you~ for he has taken his leave from here on the Pinnace Advice.
074,Feb 10th 1646,By order of Court~ 10th February 1646: Mr. Cartwright to be questioned about the white pepper brought home in the Mary~ bought by Mr. Andrews. He is also to be demanded why he did not send home the cloves upon the Mary.
075,Dec 9th 1643,Regarding Mr. Yard: By letter from Bantam on the 9th of December 1643~ touching Mr. Gard and his endeavor~ seeing the President of Surat has passed his censure on him~ and your Worships have sent for him home~ he shall return to Europe in the Hopewell. Then may your Worships do with him as you please~ as he has an estate sufficient~ we believe~ to give you more than satisfaction for his good endeavors.
075,Nov 28th 1644,By letter from Surat on the 28th of November 1644 by Crispiana and Dolphin: There were 13 bales of cloth belonging to Mr. Alle consigned unto you~ which have escaped something better than yours~ yet are reduced to six bales~ which are sent to you on the Gripp~ in which ship Mr. Varen takes his passage.
075,Jan 3rd 1644,By letter from Surat on the 3rd of January 1644 by the ship Crispiana: The 13 bales of cloth belonging to Mr. Varen~ laden at Bantam on the Hopewell~ have by disaster been reduced to six~ sent to you now upon the Crispiana. He himself also takes his passage on her~ of whom we must give this testimony: since he has cohabited with us~ his deportment has been very civil and commendable. In regard to his unfortunate business touching the Endeavor~ which was often controverted between this and the Coast's residency~ wherein he was then thought deservedly censured~ he has desired us (which~ in reason~ we could not refuse) to view several writings he has concerning that affair. In these writings~ we find that he had ample warrant for what he did in beginning her~ until then unknown to us. However unfortunate the business succeeded afterward.
075,Sep 8th 1644,By letter from Fort St. George dated the 8th of September 1644: Mr. Yard's Endeavor lies here ashore~ whose carcass is worth little~ and the ribs good for nothing but firewood. But we hope~ before this~ he has given satisfaction at home for his unwarrantable action.
076,Jan 15th 1643,By letter from Bantam of the 15th January 1643: Humphry Weston is not to be cleared~ for he has delivered two accounts concerning 861s through his indiscretion or carelessness.

077,Dec 29th 1645,By letter from Bantam of the 29th December 1645 by ship Mary: Mr. Mountfort is blamed for his poor keeping of the Company’s accounts. Until the account is perfected~ they cannot know what is due from the stock to the voyage~ etc.

For your cloth rash~ 2 quarter cask sack~ and pixe of canary~ I do allow you after the rate of 50 P.C. The gold and silver lace will serve for some necessary uses. Your bottles (quicksilver) have advanced to good profit. The 10 pieces of gold mentioned in your letter to Mr. Gurney I have received and accounted for. No. 3 Other matters concerning  the Lady Cogan and Mr. Santill mentioned in Mr. Robinson's letters come not within my knowledge.
081, NA, From Christopher Vardly to Mr. Willoughby: I have sent you by Mr. Hill~ Mrs. Mate Syone See~ 15 parish morees amounting to 18e. received from you by the Bonito in a small fardle marked Mij.
081, NA, From Hen Greenehill to Mr. Gostwick: I have received from Mr. Wilm. Purser of the Bonito your scarlet with the broadcloth that strapped it~ which lies on my hands unsold~ as also 500 Rs with Mr. Perrott sent me from Bantam for your account~ and I allow you 50 P.C. for the scarlet and 50 P.C. for the broadcloth. What returns I make you~ you will perceive by the account enclosed No. 4. I have sent your wife a gilded Christ for a cap~ a petticoat~ and 4 smocks.
081, NA, From Capt. Newport to Capt. Steevens: Here enclosed~ I send you an account of your bull of beer and of the movement of the money~ which is in sugar~ white pepper~ and ginger. No. 9
082, NA, From Charles Wild to Capt. Steevens: You may see the badness of the time at Bantam for provisions of any commodities~ but what we are forced to buy from the English merchants themselves~ who gain 20 or 30 percent. Yet make no question the lots sent to you will turn to good account~ the account whereof here enclosed will make mention No. 6. What I am indebted to you I have given out to be invested against my return from Persia~ so that if this now sent to you does not answer according to expectation~ I make no question but the next will make amends for all~ with God willing~ shall be brought home next year by myself. I have sent you home by John Gurney one bale of cloth  orners and it is marked as in the margin~ and five small bales of the same mark by pinnace. Due end via Bantam.
082, NA, From Capt. Newport to Mr. Teins: Enclosed I send you an account of the 20 pieces I received from you~ No.
082, NA, From James Bostock to Mr. Ri. Best:  My mother having earnestly complained of her poverty and the hardness of the times in England~ which I have all the reason in the world to consider and to relieve her~ I have therefore~ to comply with my duty~ sent her these following particulars~ viz.:
082, NA, Sallampores: 20 pieces~ cost Ks. 48:00:00
082, NA, Jong cloths: 4 pieces~ cost Ks. 15:00:00
082, NA, One chest of sugar~ weight 350 nett~ cost Ks. 17:00:00 Which at 5s 6d per Rs. amounts to £22 sterling.
082, NA, I have made bold to consign them unto yourself~ humbly entreating you to be pleased to favor both my mother and me by making sale thereof and delivering the proceeds to my mother~ to whom I freely give the same.
083, NA, I have also consigned unto you a small sack of nutmegs~ weight 100 nett. I pray you to sell them for my account and send me the proceeds in good wine partly~ and in what else you shall think fit for matter of provisions~ or in wine only.
083, NA, From James Bridgeman to Mr. Young: I am seated now in a good place. If you shall send anything~ I will promise to make return thereof in profitable commodities.
083, NA, From Robert Doughty to Mr. Cramer and Mr. Adams: By John Gurney I have sent Mr. Cramer 3 pieces of morees~ cost 20. By Capt. Goslyn~ I have sent unto you both two fardles marked 'Reach~' containing 20 pieces of morees~ traded at 8 per piece~ 15 pieces. I desire you to deliver also: To Mrs. Baber for her adventure in gold. 15 pieces to Mrs. Leaver for her adventure. The rest to make sale of for my account with 100 more pieces of morees~ cost 8d per piece~ in two fardles marked 'U~' sent by Capt. Goslyn. Out of its proceeds~ pay £20 unto my sister Feaser for her daughter’s adventure. What remains~ I pray~ invest in quicksilver and lead. If you shall make any addition for your own account to run in adventure with me~ I desire it may be in a small bar of silver~ for that is the least subject to damage and yields some certain profit.
083, NA, From Capt. Newport to Mr. Cramer: Here enclosed~ I send you an account of the Adventurers’ both sales and investments~ and the particulars.
083, NA, From Charles Wild to Mr. Cramer: Your vermillion and quicksilver sold at price current at 22 Ks. The mds. of 26 lbs. English. Three sets of your gold buttons for the weight.
084, NA, Of them in English gold~ with monies with the rest have left to be invested in a parcel of diamonds. As yet have procured nothing~ only sent you by the Bantam ship one small fardle containing two corge morees. Of quicksilver on your account run out~ and there is run out of the Company's 222. I desire you not to think much for not complying with your expectation in every particular~ for if my life lay on it~ I comply not~ having so much of yours and Mr. Sambrooke's and other friends' that I could not get conveyance to you for it~ but by the next return~ which~ God willing~ shall be myself~ shall give you real satisfaction. I have sent home two small fardles of cinnamon to my wife by way of Bantam with your things~ and one now with two or three small tokens.
084, NA, Mr. Wild: For friends~ I pray assist my wife in the procuring of them. Your curtains are put out to making and will be as good as any that shall come from the coast~ with valance~ tester~ quilt~ and pillowcases. They have orders to make them full of work. Your sheets and other things are not forgotten. As concerning your raw silk~ if I had gone down into the bay~ I might have procured what I would. I showed the pattern to a merchant~ a Dutchman at Masulipatam~ who has promised to help me to 200 weight at 1½ Rd. per pound. It is very likely there is a great quantity to be procured. I believe Capt. Brookehaven and they have made a mighty voyage by report. I had procured you a brave parcel of diamonds had it not been for him~ for he had left with Mr. Gardly £300 to procure them and sent over land to invest so much more. Spavens' death has made them all~ for he had 1500 monies and money's worth~ and they keep it all~ not bringing it to the Company.
085, NA, Still no transcription for the page. Has the date July 25 1651 on it. Looks like it says 'from Jon. Greenhill to Mr. … You
086, NA, Objections against m Thomas Winter:
086, NA, Mr. Winter 1. Mr. Winter~ with some others~ at one time freighted a ship wholly for the town's account with rice from Masulipatam to Madraspatam. He himself went in her and left the Company's business 8 months dead until his return~ whereby~ in a manner~ they gained 4000 for the account of Mr. Winter and others~ as is supposed. 2. In the ship Slopewell~ there was carried from the Coast to Persia 18 bales of calicoes and 734 bales only for the Company's account in the year 1644. 3. And from thence to Masulipatam~ for the account of Mr. Winter and others~ 8 bales of Rohanas and 119 chests of rosewater in the same year~ 1644. 4. Mr. Winter is by estimation worth 20~000~ besides an adventure upon the  Hopewell of 10~000 in goods sent for Persia.
086, NA, Mr. Winter and three others in the East are all sworn brothers~ and when they receive or benefit themselves in any project~ they pass an oath one to another to prosecute their intentions and not dissent from one another until their ends are obtained.
086, NA, One principal means of raising these men to the heights of pride and riches which they now possess is the keeping of such mighty stocks of money~ which they call their own~ and with which they buy up all cloth and paintings that are vendible either in South Seas or in England at certain times and seasons. And when your ships come to the coast in December~ June~ or July~ they must have 50% profit; nay~ if the ships arrive upon the coast… 
087, NA, … The coast in May has orders given by them to all the brokers and weavers dwelling within a 14 or 16-mile compass not to sell under the price set by these men. If any weaver is so needy that he undersells their price~ if they hear of it~ he is immediately rebuked and money lent to him for his present necessity. This is done so that the price of cloth and their policy shall not be found out by those whom they think might give the Company notice.
087, Jun 10 1652,  I am much troubled that I cannot send home such relations as I have~ by reason that I am so far distant from the delivery of them myself into the hands of such men as I might trust. Nevertheless~ I will venture these few lines to you to show to the Company or to be otherwise used as you shall think fit. When I came to the Court of Coromandel~ where we still are at this present~ there was Mr. Baker and Mr. Penniston with Mr. Greenehill bound for Bantam. Here~ I understood by certain relations from them that there have been nine ships employed these three years past upon the coast. The chief places of their employment are Madraspatam~ Masulipatam~ Gingee~ and Pegu. Of these nine~ some of them are bigger than the Falcon~ others less. Now~ whilst I was here~ they loaded one of the Company’s ships with their own particular goods from Masulipatam to Madraspatam~ which~ if she had been laden with the same goods for the Company~ would have gained them clear~ all charges paid~ 6000 rials of eight. This I was an eyewitness of and will be deposed on~ and this...

088, NA, … And this was done in less than a month's time. Therefore~ it is an easy matter for such men to heap up great estates. The gains from Gingerlee are never less than Co. P. Co.~ and from Pegu never less. To them that sit still here~ then C percent. Yet these places must be kept in the hands of a few~ but the Company must by no means know of it or have any share in it. Nay~ I will justify it. Cloth from the coast to Pegu makes for every rial of eight~ three rials of eight. I know I go a dangerous way for my particular in advising thus. If my letters be intercepted~ yet it is the truth and not fit to be kept from the Company's knowledge.
088, NA, Two of Mr. Penniston’s I have seen and one of Mr. Greenehill’s objections against Mr. Thomas Penniston.
088, NA, For the account of Mr. Penniston and others~ as is supposed~ in the ship Slopewell~ Penniston was carried from the coast to Persia 118 bales of calicoes and 734 bales only for the Company. And in the year 1644~ from there to Masulipatam~ for the account of Mr. Penniston and others~ 8 bales of rohanas and 119 chests of rosewater in the same year~ 1644. Mr. Penniston is~ by estimation~ worth 80~000 rials.
089, NA, Mr. Penniston and three others on the Coast are all sworn brothers~ and when they perceive they may benefit themselves in any project~ they pass an oath one to another to prosecute their intentions and not dissent one from the other until their ends be obtained. One principal means of raising these men to the height of pride and riches they now possess is the keeping of such mighty stocks of money~ which they call their own~ and with which they buy up all cloth and paintings that are vendible either in the South Seas or in England at certain times and seasons. And when the ships come to the Coast in June or July~ they must have 50% profit. Nay~ if the ships arrive upon the Coast in May~ there is an order given by them to all the brokers and weavers dwelling within 14 or 16 miles' compass not to sell under the prices set by these men. And if any weaver be so needy that he does undersell their price~ if they hear of it~ he is presently rebuked and money lent to him for his present necessity. This is done so that the price of cloth and their policy shall not be found out by those whom they think will give the Company notice.
089, Jun 10 1652, NA
090, Feb 5th 1652,  From Fort St. George: Two junks belonging to private trade~ that were for the most part~ if not altogether~ laden by Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Edward Steevens~ as we have heard in the Bay. A good part of the money that paid for the lading was borrowed by Steevens from some of the country people in the Company’s name~ and for all that is known~ the Company may be forced to make satisfaction for it.
090, NA, You see what imprudent private traders the Bay affords. The pinnace Mariner~ built by Mr. Bridgeman~ we believe has cost the Company more than a good vessel of 100 tons would have done in England~ and yet this vessel is not above 30 or 35 tons at the most.
090, Jan. 8th 1652, From Fort St. George: Mr. Bridgeman has not sent up the Ballasore books of accounts~ for want whereof the accounts between the Bay and this place cannot be effected. We conceive it will not be safe to pay him much money at home or whatever money else he claims as due to him on the basis of his Bengal books until further advice. Mr. May is to be paid by Mr. Bridgeman for his last voyage~ and he is to demand it of him. If Bridgeman denies to pay him~ the Company will assist him in it.
091, Aug 18th 1650, By letter from Thomas Codington Aberrations against the Company.
091, Aug 18th 1650, Abuses offered unto the Company by their own
Servants: 1. In fathering of goods inwards belonging to Moors and Armenian merchants, which ought to pay custom to you and the King of Persia. This they take to themselves. 2. The bribes taken of the Shahbandar by the chief here to make up the moiety of customs as he pleases himself. 3. The coloring of other men’s goods outward, wherein you are no sharers with this King~ for which great bribes are taken by them. 4. The disposing of your goods and business without the council or knowledge of other servants in this factory~ contrary to your orders.
091, NA, I wrote of other things likewise to your Worships and sent them down to the port by Thomas Best~ who most treacherously and basely opened my letters and imparted the contents to Mr. Lewis~ whom it most concerns~ as likewise to the President in Surat~ aggravating things to the worst sense. By this service~ he has gotten to be second of this  factory~ sending the said letter to Mr. Lewis~ by which means it did not take its passage to England that year~ nor ever is likely to unless you demand it of him. So well you are dealt with by those you nourish.
091, NA, Lewis confessed to the linguist that he would not have taken that course with Codington if Codington had complied with him. If one ship which transports their goods to Gombroon should miscarry~ it would make 20 leggers.
092, Jan 17th 1652, Objections concerning the Smyrna Merchant By letter from Surat: The second of the Lord before this entered there~ neither have you been only prejudiced by the sale of goods brought from Europe~ but also by their beginning to sell some commodities you have marketed here~ and that in a most conceivable manner. For when~ upon the seizing of the two Deccan junks by us~ they had their cardamoms stopped~ which we expected from you~ we endeavored to furnish you elsewhere. A vessel came into this road with about 40 or 50 bales of that commodity~ offering them to us for sale. We drew near to a price for them and acquainted Capt. Hurleston~ desiring him to command his people not to attempt to meddle with them. Since there were no other buyers for them~ we were sure they would be ours.
092, NA, He carefully performed what we desired~ yet notwithstanding what he or we could do~ they were bought out of our hands at 25 PGs more than we would have paid for them. By the best intelligence we have~ they are laden aboard the ship~ which we question not~ but if you please to inquire after~ you will find to be true.
092, NA, Private Trade brought to Surat aboard the Smyrna Merchant: Quicksilver: 310 great maunds. Vermillion: 40. Cloth: 298 pieces = 5~946 yards. 90 bales judicoe returned on shore for lack of roomFour or five boxes of white sugar not brought home~ but left
at Surat, the ship not being capable of repeating
as I amended.
093, NA, This to be read first for the Smyrna Merchant: We have not been wanting~ to the utmost of our power~ to stop that stream of private trade that runs so strongly to your prejudice in this port. But we find that in it~ we contend even with the ocean~ for we cannot remedy it. Most of those we employ to hinder it turn confederates~ and such as do not procure themselves a beating dare act no more. And when our brokers have been terrified with our threats~ those that belong to the Dutch have been made use of and entered cloth and quicksilver in their names~ and it goes for current.
093, NA, And though we have taken 30 or 40 pieces of cloth and as many chests of quicksilver at a time in the custom house~ yet they have been so much befriended as to get it cleared whether we would or not. All our effort~ besides our trouble~ has only produced a list of the cloth and quicksilver that has been entered by private traders out of the Smyrna Merchant in the custom house of Surat. By which you may perceive how well the market will be supplied if you send none of those commodities.
093, NA, If you cannot remedy this in England~ the ways they have now found out will render us incapable of doing you the service therein as our duty binds us~ or as we desire.
094, NA, Objections against Mr. Thomas Merry:
094, NA, Mr. Merry to give an account of how the 170 demands for his debt in Persia are satisfied.
094, NA, Mr. Merry is charged with 575~ 3 mamoodies for interest.
094, NA, Half of the £42 freight to be allowed him.
094, NA, The £50 not brought to cash as paid.
094, NA, A abatement of waste in the musk to be made according to others that are weighed.
094, NA, The £50 paid for Eyan’s business not to be allowed because it was paid without consultation~ and that £50 being paid by Iward to end the suit.
094, NA, Mr. Merry to be charged with the penalty of his bond and the freight and customs in Persia for any private trade found not presented by him~ especially in the Falcon.
094, NA, To give a reason why he did not question Hero Vora~ a Banian broker~ who is a chief and has stolen from the Company 30~000 mamoodies. Upon complaint by Mr. Trumball~ though it was known long before~ Hero Vora was never questioned by Mr. Merry or others.
094, NA, Mr. Merry used Mr. Trumball very maliciously and debarred him from hearing the word of God~ and from the use of the sacrament. He also detained him in India a whole year out of employment against his will. He was despised and slighted by all Mr. Merry’s family and night and day abused by the young men in the house for turning their bales ashore when the ship was full.
095, NA, Mr. Merry: Why Mr. Merry did not question the carpenter of the Falcon for his great private trade in the ship~ the freight whereof amounted to above £70.
095, NA, Why Pritherow~ the surgeon~ was not also questioned about his private trade~ the freight whereof amounted to £45.Why 400 and odd bales of goods were sent to Persia in the Falcon in 1648~ but only 19 bales for the Company~ although goods were then sold there at 50 to 70 per pound~ and some tannin sorts yielded more.
095, NA, Why Persia was traded that year with 70~000 commodities~ whereby the benefit of customs due to the Company there was in danger of being lost~ when yearly they did not trade there for more than 10~000 commodities.
095, NA, Why Mr. Bradbent~ in the Blessing in 1648~ carried into Persia nearly 600 bales of goods and only 24 for the Company.
095, NA, Why the Falcon in 1649 was laden for Bussora~ and not one bale for the Company~ nor anything save pepper shot among the goods~ which caused 1~800 Rs. of the sale to be hindered to the Company’s loss.
095, NA, Why a large quantity of pepper sent from Gombroon to Persia by Mr. Insh before the Falcon came there was lost.
095, NA, Why one young man should have 100 or 150 bales laden off the Mariane at the beginning of a monsoon~ as such cargoes greatly hinder the sale of the Company’s goods and lower the market by bringing goods too cheaply.
095, NA, Why one young man was allowed to ship off the Mariane in 1650 £10~000 worth of goods~ besides boasting that he had~ in addition~ 20 bales more of goods~ which he carried from the Mariane because the ship could not take them in.
096, NA, Why Mr. Merry did not question Mr. Davida~ who~ upon complaint of Mr. Harndersly~ in four years has pleased himself with £33~000 out of the investments and bargains he has made for the Company at Agra.
096, NA, Why Mr. Merry taxed Mr. Trumball with leaving behind him 190 bales of rohanas at Persia~ when he brought 440 pieces of freight goods in the hold and horses for Mr. Merry~ with their extraordinary provisions~ whose straw had nearly set the ship on fire. Besides other goods~ being in all 469 bales~ and 101 passengers~ each with 4 or 5 sacks of provisions:
096, NA, Bags of money~ whereof: 5 large~ 1 small marked. 1 chest of Mr. Mares. 1 secretary marked 'M'. 2 chests of rhubarb. 20 bales of silver marked #.
096, NA, For himself and friends: 17 bags of money for Mr. Lewis. 5 bags of money marked. Besides a great quantity of private trade carried for himself in several ships and permitting the same to be done by divers others~ for which custom and freight is due.
097, NA, Objections against Mr. Richard Davidge 1. The articles and observations exhibited against Mr. Davidge by Mr. Fra Hamersly~ to be read through on 15th January 1651. 2. As also his request of the same date to the President. 3. Other articles exhibited against Mr. Davidge by Mr. Hamersly on 16th January 1651. 4. Mr. Davidge's answers to those objections of Mr. Hamersly. 5. Mr. Hamersly’s letter to the Company on 23rd January 1651. 6. The President and Council write to Mr. Isson to examine the brokers’ books on 27th January 1651. 7. Mr. Davidge carried the brokers’ books away on March 1651. 8. The particulars and costs of sundry sorts of goods bought by Mr. Davidge. 9. Mr. Davidge’s account of barter. 10. Mr. Davidge’s private trade homewards as per bills of lading.
097, Jan. 17 1652, By letter from Surat: And we shall begin with the business of Mr. Richard Davidge~ which~ as we told you in our last~ we could not lay down so as to be  satisfied with what was then discovered. By two letters to Mr. Isson to make diligent inquiry~ we have received from him a second account~ wherein there appears 1~569 dupees not brought by Mr. Davidge.
098, NA, Mr. Davidge brought to your credit~ neither with this should we have been satisfied~ but that Mr. Isson from Agra advises us that had not his book~ out of which it was taken by chance~ escaped Mr. Davidge~ it would have been impossible to have discovered anything of it. For all the brokers’ books he could lay hands on~ he carried with him. But these will be sufficient to let you know you are abused~ and we hope you have in your hands what is needed to make satisfaction. A copy of the Agra letter of the 30th of April will more at large inform you.
098, NA, Per relation of Dacres: 'Dapte Remport Met Jongh Ten' Our clerks affirm Frederick Bijnner to be a great gamester at tables~ playing at tick-tack 40 rials of eight a hit with the Dutch. And two different sorts of weights. 
098, NA, Letter from Surat~ 19th November 1650:  Mr. Mosse's irregular proceedings there.
098, NA, Letter from Surat~ 31st January 1650 Mr. Mosse's reprisal of two Malabar frigates. Mr. Porter and Mr. James to pay for their diet. Mr. Hamersly complained of the same.
098, NA, Complaints against Mr. Porter and Mr. Henry Barrett: Barrett’s insolence and Porter’s misconduct.
099, NA, Objections Against Robert Doughty: Dec. 28~ 1652: By Consultation: Robert Doughty protested against for not delivering a true account of remains.
099, Jan. 5th 1652, By Consultation: Robert Doughty found to be indebted to the Company 1~168 ℞ 21d. for cloth wanting.
099, Jan. 16th 1652, By Consultation: Robert Doughty charged with 100 Rt~ which he received
rom Ray Mrrea Moniaqah, being due to the Company, etc.
099, Jan. 16th 1652, Mr. Doughty gives in his accounts foul and unbalanced. We received 100 Rt from one that stood indebted to the Company. They arrested his chest and secretaries for security for this debt. He has left them some bills of adventurers he has abroad.
099, Sep. 25th 1653,  Objections Against Mr. Ma. Andrews & Pieter Mr. John Lambton: Mr. Andrews and Mr. Lambton~ by Mr. Elder's order~ have laden 13 bales of Deriabads aboard the Supply~ as they write~ for his account. They promise to send him advice of his affairs by the present shipping and praise their further care to secure what of his estate is remaining there.
099, NA, Mr. Frederick Skinner: By using two sorts of weights and other misdemeanors~ Mr. Skinner has caused a great shortage of goods sent home by him in the East India Merchant~ which arrived here in August 1653~ being short of what was invoiced as follows: Besides the Benjamin~ extremely coarse~ but his own as good as ever came into England. Nutmeg and Benjamin of the best for his own account.
100, NA, Objections Against Mr. James Bridgeman~ to which he is desired to give his answer in writing: By his letter of the 15th December 1650 to Mr. Stralmaker~ he acknowledges having carried out a large adventure for him. Further~ he invites him to India (without the Company’s consent)~ promising him a welcome~ stating that he was able to do it~ as he was then chief of all the factors in Bengal.
100, NA, By another letter of the same date to Mr. John Younge~ he states that he is seated in a good place and encourages him to send goods to India~ for which he promises to make returns in profitable commodities.
100, NA, By letter of the 8th January 1652 from Fort St. George~ it is advised that he has not provided the Ballasore books of accounts. For want thereof~ they could not perfect the accounts between the Bay and Fort St. George. Therefore~ they conceive it not safe to pay him much money at home or whatever money he claims as due to him on the basis of his Bengal books until further advice.
100, NA, By letter of the 5th February 1652 from Fort St. George~ it is advised that the two junks which wintered at Goa belong to private traders. Most~ if not all~ of their lading belongs to Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Steevens. A good part of the money that paid for their lading was borrowed from the country people in the Company’s name~ whereby the Company may be forced to make satisfaction for it.
100, NA, Also~ the pinnace Mariner~ not above 35 tons at most and in very poor condition~ was built by him without the Company’s order. It cost more than a good vessel of 100 tons would have cost in England.
101, NA, By letter of the 18th January 1653 from Surat to Persia: It is advised that Mr. Bridgeman and others are deeply engaged with Mr. Cherry and have given a warrant bill in the Company’s name to see their creditors satisfied.
101, NA, By another letter of the same date from Surat: It is written that Mr. Bridgeman and others have gained a suspension of paying present customs~ by late presents~ thereby advancing their own and all private traders' benefits. They have paid no customs for three years and are now called to account for all~ with the Company’s stock likely to be used for satisfaction. He has also taken up money at interest to supply his private trade~ and in case of its miscarriage abroad~ he has engaged the Company~ by his writing~ to pay it.
101, NA, By letter of the 17th August 1653: It is certified that Mr. Boughton had a great share in the two junks and died in debt to one Churmull between 5~000 and 6~000 rupees with interest~ who now demands satisfaction from the Company. Mr. Steevens also died in debt to several men~ owing 4~000 or 5~000 rupees. Mr. Bridgeman~ Mr. Blake~ and Mr. Pitts obligated payment of these debts out of the Company’s stock in case of miscarriage~ by writing under their hands. Additionally~ 1~343 rupees are owed to the Company by the said Steevens. Mr. Bridgeman~ Mr. Waldegrave~ and others have some share in the two junks~ which were at Mr. Cherry’s disposal in Persia.
101, NA, Mr. Bridgeman states the shares were: Mr. Bridgeman: 3/8~ Mr. Cherry 1/8~ Mr. Boughton: 2/8~ Mr. May 1/8~ Mr. Waldegrave: 1/8
101, NA, But it is supposed that Mr. Steevens had a share as well. And Mr. Bridgeman is believed to have had a greater share than was shown to him. On the 5th October 1654~ he himself acknowledged this in the morning.
102, NA, Objections Against Mr. Fra. Hamersly The President and Council at Surat write:
102, Jan. 31st 1650, They complain they are forced to let him stay longer due to his debts with the country people~ for which the Company may be troubled~ despite the Company’s orders for him to return home.
102, Jan. 17th 1652, He takes up money at interest for private trade.
